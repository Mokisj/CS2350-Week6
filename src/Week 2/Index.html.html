            I will consider a college degree to be my highest achievement when I finish it. Additionally, I have a few
            other awards. In high school, I played a few sports, with soccer being the sport I was most passionate
            about. I have played soccer my entire life. Some of the awards I received include the Summer Games
            Champions, President's Cup champions, and, lastly, the High School 6-A Champions. Similar to the picture
            above, i competeted in snow mobile racing. I only competed for a few years, but it was still one of my
            favorite sports I've done in my life.

    <h2 class="s3">Interests and Hobbies</h2>

    <p class="BodyText">
        As mentioned before, I am a competitive soccer player and still love to play. Since graduating from high school
        with a torn meniscus, it has been difficult for me to get back into the athletic scene. As an alternative, I
        developed an interest in weightlifting and started bodybuilding. I have been bodybuilding for 3 years now, and I
        still find it amazing. I am planning to do my first show in a few months!

        Among my other hobbies, I enjoy playing with my dog and gaming with a few buddies. I don't enjoy gaming alone,
        so it can be challenging to find people online whom I want to play with.
    </p>

    <h2 class="s4">This is me!</h2>

    <p class="BodyText">
        This is me! I am a passionate and competitive soccer player who has been playing the sport my entire life.
        Despite facing challenges such as a torn meniscus after high school, I have found an alternative in
        weightlifting and have been bodybuilding for the past three years. It's amazing to see the progress I've made,
        and I'm excited to participate in my first bodybuilding show in a few months.

        Aside from my athletic pursuits, I enjoy spending time with my dog and gaming with close friends. Playing with
        my dog brings me joy, and gaming is a great way to connect with my buddies, although I prefer playing with
        others rather than gaming alone. Finding like-minded people online can be a bit challenging, but it's worth it
        when I get to engage in fun gaming sessions together. This is me, a dedicated athlete, a lover of dogs, and a
        gamer who thrives on social connections
